=== C# Coding Style:

  - exceptions:                   PascalCasingException
  - interfaces:                   IPascalCasing
  - enums:                     (e)PascalCasing
  - classes:                   (c)PascalCasing
  - struct:                    (s)PascalCasing

  - parameters:                   camelCasing(_in)
  - public properties:            PascalCasing
  - private properties:           camelCasing_ / lowercasing_
  - private properties*:          camelCasing__ / lowercasing__
    * access should'nt be made directly
  - public methods:               PascalCasing
  - private methods:              camelCasing / lowercasing

  ?
  - aux variables:      (_)lowercasing
  - out variables:      camelCasing/PascalCasing_out  / lowercasing

=== Other considerations:
- in case a private field is related with some property, it goes along with such property, otherwise is goes into private fields region.
- in case private method is related with some method, it goes along with such method, otherwise is goes into private methods region.
